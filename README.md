XKCD Display
============

At the [35c3][] I've seen a very intriguing (and hopefully easy to build)
display by [Freies Labor Hildesheim][freieslabor]. It showd Randall Munroes
famous [xkcd][] comics, and now I want to build one myself.

The repo will one day hopefully contain a build instructions and the required
software to run is. But please be patient, I'm just starting this.
